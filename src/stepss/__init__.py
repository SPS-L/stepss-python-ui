"""stepss - Python interface to the STEPSS power-system simulation platform.

Drives RAMSES, the time-domain dynamic simulator, and Helios, the AC
power-flow engine, both of which ship as bundled shared libraries.

Public API exported by this package:

- :class:`~stepss.cases.cfg` - build and manage a simulation case (input/output files).
- :class:`~stepss.simulator.sim` - load the RAMSES shared library and run simulations.
- :class:`~stepss.extractor.extractor` - parse Fortran binary trajectory files post-simulation.
- :class:`~stepss.extractor.cur` - lightweight NamedTuple holding a (time, value, msg) timeseries.
- :func:`~stepss.extractor.curplot` - plot one or more :class:`cur` objects on a single axes.
- :class:`~stepss.live.monitor` - plot chosen quantities while a simulation runs.
- :mod:`stepss.ssa` - run and read a small-signal stability analysis.
- :class:`~stepss.helios.HeliosSession` - run AC power flows with the Helios engine.
- :class:`~stepss.globals.HeliosError` - exception raised by Helios calls.

Module-level flags set at import time:

- ``__runTimeObs__`` - always ``True``. Run-time observables no longer depend on
  anything being installed, so this flag has nothing left to report. It is kept
  because it is public, and it is deprecated: do not branch on it.

# No gnuplot probe. This package has always plotted with matplotlib, through
# curplot; the probe existed because RAMSES used to draw run-time observables
# itself by piping to gnuplot, so a machine without gnuplot could not produce
# them. RAMSES no longer does that: it writes the observable file and calls
# nothing, so gnuplot's presence has no bearing on anything here.
#
# Leaving the probe in place was not merely untidy. addRunObs() gated on this
# flag and became a silent no-op when the probe failed, so every user without
# gnuplot installed lost run-time observables for a reason that no longer
# existed. Kept as a name, always True, because it is documented public API.
